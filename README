Copy all the text from my example vim configuration, adjust it as needed. 
-Language sensitive
-Autotabbing with 4 spaces
-Color codes variables/function names/etc

Paste the text into ~/.vimrc
If vimrc doesn't exist on your machine, create it and vim will automatically source 
the configuation to that location.
